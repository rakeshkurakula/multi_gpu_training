# Multi-GPU Training with PyTorch Lightning

This repository demonstrates the transition from vanilla PyTorch to PyTorch Lightning for efficient multi-GPU training.

## Overview

Deep learning models are becoming increasingly complex, requiring more computational resources. Training these models on multiple GPUs can significantly reduce training time. However, implementing multi-GPU training in vanilla PyTorch can be challenging due to:

1. Complex training loop management
2. Distributed training setup
3. Debugging in distributed settings
4. Mixed precision training
5. Logging and monitoring
6. Device management

PyTorch Lightning provides a high-level interface that abstracts away these complexities, allowing researchers and practitioners to focus on model development rather than engineering details.

## Repository Structure

- `pytorch_lightning.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook demonstrating the transition from PyTorch to PyTorch Lightning
- `multi_gpu_training.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook focusing on multi-GPU training strategies
- Various example models and training scripts

## PyTorch vs. PyTorch Lightning

### Vanilla PyTorch Approach

In vanilla PyTorch, you need to manually:
- Define the training loop
- Handle device placement
- Implement distributed training logic
- Set up logging and checkpointing
- Manage mixed precision training

This leads to boilerplate code that can be error-prone and difficult to maintain.

### PyTorch Lightning Approach

PyTorch Lightning provides a structured approach by:
- Separating research code from engineering code
- Automating device placement and distributed training
- Providing built-in logging and monitoring
- Simplifying mixed precision training
- Enabling easy debugging

## Key Benefits of PyTorch Lightning

1. **Simplified Code**: Focus on model architecture and logic rather than training loop details
2. **Automatic Optimization**: Handles distributed training, mixed precision, and gradient accumulation
3. **Built-in Logging**: Integrates with popular logging frameworks like TensorBoard
4. **Reproducibility**: Standardized structure makes experiments more reproducible
5. **Scalability**: Easily scale from single GPU to multi-GPU or TPU without code changes

## Getting Started

1. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision pytorch-lightning torchmetrics
```

2. Run the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook pytorch_lightning.ipynb
```

3. Explore the transition from PyTorch to PyTorch Lightning and multi-GPU training examples.

## Multi-GPU Training Strategies

PyTorch Lightning makes multi-GPU training straightforward:

```python
# Single line change to enable multi-GPU training
trainer = pl.Trainer(accelerator="gpu", devices=2)  # Use 2 GPUs
```

No need to manually implement DistributedDataParallel or DataParallel - Lightning handles it automatically!

### Data Parallel (DP)

```python
trainer = pl.Trainer(accelerator="gpu", devices=2, strategy="dp")
```

**Process in DP strategy:**
- The central machine replicates the model to all GPUs
- Individual GPUs process their portion of the data and communicate outputs back to the central machine
- The central machine computes loss and gradients, then updates the model weights
- Updated weights are sent back to individual GPUs

**Limitation:** The model is still trained on one device, which can become a bottleneck.

### Distributed Data Parallel (DDP)

```python
trainer = pl.Trainer(accelerator="gpu", devices=2, strategy="ddp")
```

**Process in DDP strategy:**
- The model is replicated to all GPUs (happens once)
- Individual GPUs compute gradients independently
- Gradients are communicated between GPUs, and all replicas get updated
- The central machine is never overloaded with model outputs

DDP is generally more efficient than DP for multi-GPU training as it distributes both the data and computation across devices.

## Advanced Features

- **Gradient Accumulation**: `trainer = pl.Trainer(accumulate_grad_batches=4)`
- **Mixed Precision**: `trainer = pl.Trainer(precision=16)`
- **Checkpointing**: `trainer = pl.Trainer(callbacks=[ModelCheckpoint()])`
- **Early Stopping**: `trainer = pl.Trainer(callbacks=[EarlyStopping()])`
- **Custom Callbacks**: Create custom callbacks to monitor training progress

## Conclusion

PyTorch Lightning significantly simplifies the implementation of multi-GPU training while maintaining the flexibility of PyTorch. By abstracting away the engineering complexities, it allows researchers and practitioners to focus on model development and experimentation.
